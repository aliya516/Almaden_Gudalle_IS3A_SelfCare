                <h3 class="facial-step">
                  Straight hair, known for its sleek look and resilient strands,
                  often falls evenly around the scalp. Common concerns include
                  dryness, tangles, and frizz caused by dehydration.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To boost volume, try blow-drying upside down or brushing hair
                  in the opposite direction. Using a leave-in conditioner 2–3
                  times a week can also help. Look for fatty acids in
                  conditioners, as they promote hair growth and density.

                  <h3 class="facial-step">
                    Wavy hair naturally has a thicker texture and often feels
                    coarse, making it prone to frizz and tricky to manage.
                    Humidity can exacerbate the frizz, causing hair to become
                    unmanageable and flyaway.
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Daily exposure to heat and moisture can further damage wavy
                    hair, making it unruly. To care for it, dry with a
                    microfiber towel to minimize friction and static. Swap
                    brushes for wide-toothed combs to retain moisture and
                    prevent dryness. Wavy hair is ideal for effortless beachy
                    waves when left down.

                <h2>Curly Hair</h2>
                <h3 class="facial-step">
                  Curly hair has distinct, springy curls that appear straight
                  when wet but curl up as it dries. Typically, curly hair is
                  thick and less prone to breakage, though it can easily become
                  frizzy in humid conditions.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  To prevent breakage, it's best to avoid heat styling. Use a
                  conditioner that deeply moisturizes without weighing the hair
                  down or making it stiff. To reduce tangles and split ends, use
                  a wide-toothed comb to gently detangle your curls.

                  <p>
                    For dry or color-treated hair, use sulfate-free shampoos to
                    prevent further dryness. For dry or frizzy hair, choose
                    conditioners that contain hydrating ingredients such as
                    argan oil or keratin to nourish and smooth. If you have oily
                    hair, go for lightweight, volumizing products that won’t
                    weigh it down.

                <h3 class="facial-step">
                  Hair conditioners are essential moisturizing treatments that
                  provide a protective layer on the hair, helping to restore
                  moisture lost during shampooing. They not only protect the
                  hair from breakage but also enhance its shine and reduce
                  frizz, leaving it smoother and more manageable.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  After shampooing, gently squeeze out excess water from your
                  hair and apply the conditioner, focusing on the ends first and
                  working your way up to the roots. Leave it on for a few
                  minutes to allow the product to deeply penetrate the hair,
                  then rinse thoroughly. For best results, consider using a
                  conditioner tailored to your hair type, whether it’s a deeply
                  nourishing formula for dry hair or a lightweight option for
                  finer hair. Regular conditioning will not only improve the
                  texture and appearance of your hair but also protect it from
                  daily environmental stressors.

                    Hair masks are an excellent treatment for dry hair, designed
                    to repair and improve its overall condition. They work to
                    soften, hydrate, strengthen, and restore your hair while
                    adding a healthy sheen in less than an hour.
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Using a hair mask at least once a week can boost your hair’s
                    smoothness and shine without making it greasy. If you enjoy
                    DIY treatments, try making a simple, hydrating hair mask at
                    home. For dry and brittle hair, a two-ingredient recipe is
                    ideal. Combine two tablespoons of natural yogurt with one
                    tablespoon of honey in a bowl. Apply the mixture to your
                    hair, starting from the scalp and working to the ends. Leave
                    it on for 20 minutes, then rinse and wash as usual. Hair
                    masks are an effective way to revive dry hair and enhance
                    its softness and vitality—give it a try!

                  Hot water can strip your scalp of natural oils, leading to
                  dryness, weak roots, frizz, and dull hair. Cold water, on the
                  other hand, can close pores too soon, preventing hair products
                  from working effectively.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  For the best results, start with warm water to open cuticles

                  <h3 class="facial-step">
                    The old rule of trimming hair every six weeks isn’t
                    universal—some people trim just a few times a year and
                    maintain healthy hair.
                  </h3>
                  <p>
                    Hair typically starts splitting after about 3 months, so
                    trimming every 3–4 months is ideal to prevent split ends,
                    reduce breakage, and minimize frizz. For those growing their
                    hair, deep conditioning can help delay split ends, allowing
                    trims every 6–8 months instead. Additionally, brushing dry
                    hair helps distribute natural oils from the scalp to the
                    ends, promoting healthier strands.

                <p>
                  When detangling wet hair, opt for a wide-tooth comb to
                  minimize breakage and gently work through knots. Avoid
                  over-brushing, as it can weaken the strands and lead to
